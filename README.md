**Disclaimer**
This is unfinished but a cool concept. Maybe I'll come back.  Maybe ansible would be better for this kinda thing? idk

Oh yeah and there is a private ssh key in this repo but it's ok because the box and public key it went with are long dead so don't hurt me. 
I know its bad but if you can find something that key opens you can have it.
But like I won't do it again, I swear.
